Spatwork
=============

Simple REST API for keeping scores about who's the best in the office (just kidding).

Build with `mvn package` and load the war in whatever container you want or simply launch `spatwork.AppServer`.
You will need a [mongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) server running on localhost. It takes just few seconds to set up.

## Credits

Built using [restx.io](http://restx.io) and integrates with mongoDB thanks to [jongo](http://jongo.org) API.
